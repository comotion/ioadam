adam6066.pl - ADAM-6066 Remote IO 6-ch Digital Input and Power Relay

This script allows you to control ADAM-6066 through the shell.

Initial version: 2009-05-14
Author: Kacper Wysocki <kwy@redpill-linpro.com>

Usage:
    The 6066 has 6 Digital Inputs and 6 switchable relays we call Digital
    Outputs.

    The ADAM communicates using an ASCII command set over port 1025/udp.

    This program lets you get the state of all inputs and outputs, as well
    as set, reset, toggle, force and time-delay with a simple command line.
